# Web-App_Code-Quiz

## Description 
	Quiz application that tests my knowledge on coding topics. The quiz cycles through the questions array to produce questions and answers to save them on the screen and then end and
	display a user score input box and a high score save box with the users initials.

## Usage 
		The user clicks the start button to start the quiz questions. Then the user is presented with a question title and four choices and must choose one. On correct answer the user is
		points on an incorrect answer the user has 5 seconds subtracted from their original quiz time of 100 seconds. At the end an end screen shows up with an input bar to enter your initials 
		and a save button to save your score into the high score section.

need to make a function to log scores as well
