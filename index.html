                    Press the start button to take this coding quiz challenge to test your code knowledge. When you press start a 
                    timer will start counting down at 100 seconds and yo will be prompted with multiple choice questions about
                    coding to answer. If you get an answer incorrect five seconds will be deducted off of the clock. If you get a question
                    correct you will earn five points. After answering a question correctly press the next button to proceed to 
                    the next question. When you answer a question wrong you will be automatically cycled to a new question. 
                    The quiz ends when either you run out of time or go through all of the questions. At the end of the quiz you'll be 
                    prompted to enter your intials to store with your score.
