                timer will start counting down at 100 seconds and you will be prompted with multiple choice questions about
                coding to answer. If you get an answer incorrect five seconds will be deducted off of the clock. If you get a question
                correct you will earn five points. After answering a question correctly press the next button to proceed to 
                the next question. When you answer a question wrong you will be automatically cycled to a new question.
